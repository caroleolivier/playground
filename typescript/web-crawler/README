# web-crawler

A web crawler that crawls the domain of a given URL.

The entry point is [index.ts](./src/index.ts).  
I focused on the crawler algorithm whose logic is in [crawler.ts](./src/crawler.ts).  
(the rest is a little bit neglected).  
At a very high level:

1. It reads a URL from the command line
2. It creates a visited graph of URLs by visiting recursively and in parallel each page.
3. It prints the graph to the console.

So the result of the program is what's printed out.  
It contains both the logs and the results of the crawler as I am logging everything to stdout.  
The list of URLs on the domain can be found after the log line `CRAWLING RESULT`.

ℹ️ The crawler is not optimized for performance or resilience or usability.  
It was done under time constraints (4 hours).
A larger domain will certainly overflow the stack or break things at the network layer.

### TODOs

There's a long list of things I'd love to do:

- Test coverage:  
  I focused on the algo for crawling the pages rather than the fetching of pages and extraction of links.
  So it's missing some high level tests (starting on `index.ts`) and more granular tests in `urlsExtractor.ts`.

- Error handling improvement

  - Page loading error
  - Bad links
  - Errors in the logs (e.g. I am not handling well links that references section like `#main` or phone number or `mailto`)

- External libraries  
  Better investigation of the HTML parser library (I picked the 1st one that looked good enough)

- Logging  
  Migrate `console.log` to actual logger

- Explore other type of links than `<a />`
  My crawler won't find non semantic HTML links.

- Performance  
  I didn't do any performance improvements.

- Resilience
  It can't run successfully on large domain like Wikipedia.
  Even if Wikipedia seems to be kind enough to let me crawl the domain, the program crashes as it runs out of memory.

- Results  
  Improve how the results are displayed/stored.

## Install & Run

### Requirements

You'll need:

- node 21.1.0

### Running locally

Install dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

Run with [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node)

```
$ npm run start:local https://www.theguardian.com 2>&1 | tee output.log
```

### Testing

I've used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to write and run the tests.

```
$ npm run test
```
